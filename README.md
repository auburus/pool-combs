Pool Combinations
================

This project aims to identify which is the worst case, and the maximum number
of movements that had to be made between a random start position of the balls
and the "good" one.

For this, it starts as the good position and keeps moving the balls around, counting
the moves, until it maps all the possibilities.

So far, counting "Swapping" and "Rotate" as valid moves, it can be done in **6 moves**.
